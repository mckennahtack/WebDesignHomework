        <p> <b>The Bystander Effect</b> 
            The bystander effect is a social phenomenon where individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present.
          Essentially, the presence of others diminishes the likelihood of any one individual offering assistance to someone in need. 
          This effect occurs due to a diffusion of responsibility, where individuals may feel less personally responsible to intervene because they assume someone else will take action or they believe their own action won't make a significant difference in a crowd. 
          The bystander effect has been observed in various situations, ranging from emergencies and accidents to instances of harassment or violence..</p>

            Public Emergencies: And example of a situation that the bystander effect happened is in a crowded public places, such as subway stations or busy streets, individuals may hesitate to offer assistance during medical emergencies or accidents, assuming that others will take action or that the situation is already under control.

            Another example would be online harassment: In online communities or social media platforms, bystanders may witness instances of cyberbullying or harassment but refrain from intervening or reporting the behavior, assuming that others will address it or that their actions won't make a difference. <span id="be2">Here you can see a graph.</span></span>
