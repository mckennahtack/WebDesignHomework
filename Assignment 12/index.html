    <h1>How to tie the Quad Knot for a top rope anchor</h1>
    <section>

        <div class="opening-paragraph">
           The Quad Knot is a great anchor that you can use for top-rope climbing. The 'Quad Anchor' is an anchor system which self-adjusts to keep an equal force on each anchor point. 
            It can be better than other methods of equalizing in certain situations.

           <h3>Advantages</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
            Distributes the load equally between the anchor pieces. This puts less force on each piece, therefore decreasing the likelihood of anchor point failure.
            </li>
            Provides two independent attachment points for the belayer and climber. This helps to prevent carabiners from jamming up at the same master point.
            <li>
            The two attachment points adjust laterally, meaning that the anchor remains equalized even when different directions of pull are applied at the same time. This is useful during multi-pitch belay changeovers, or if the route traverses in or out from the belay.
            </li>
            <li>
            On multi-pitch routes where you have bolted anchors that are approximately the same, you can speed up your anchor building by keeping the quad tied.
           </li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The quad will extend slightly should either anchor point fail. This can shock-load the remaining piece(s).
                </li>
                <li>Since the quad needs to be doubled up, it is difficult to equalize anchors where the placements are far apart.
                </li>
                </ul>

        <h3>How To Tie The Quad Anchor</h3>

        You Will Need:
        <ul>
            <li>2, 3 or 4 solid anchor points</li>
            <li>A cordelette</li>
            <li>3-5 screwgate carabiners</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
   <div>
        <img class="directionImage" src="./images/cordelette-1.png" alt="stepOne">
        <div class="direction">
            <h3>Step One</h3>
            Double over a cordelette so there are four strands of cord. Make sure the double fisherman’s knot of the cordelette is near one end.
        </div>
   </div>

        <div class="direction">
            <h3>Step Two</h3>
            <p>Tie a ‘load-limiting’ knot on one side of the cordelette. This can be either an overhand knot or a figure-8 
                (The figure-8 is easier to untie after loading. The overhand uses slightly less cord).
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <img class="directionImage" src="./images/quad-anchor-1.png" alt="stepOne">
        <div class="direction">
            <h3>Step Three</h3>
            <p>TTie another load-limiting knot on the other side and clip both ends of the cordelette to the anchor points with screwgate carabiners. Make sure the knots are fairly even when the anchor is weighted in the direction of loading. The four-strand ‘master point’ should normally be around 12 inches long.

                These load-limiting knots minimize the distance the cordelette drops if one anchor point fails. The closer you tie these knots to the master point, the less shock-loading is applied to the remaining anchor point.
                
                If the strength of your anchor points are difficult to assess (e.g: older bolts), you should move the overhand knots closer together. However, this also reduces the lateral range over which the quad self-equalizes.

            <h3>Step Four</h3>
            <p>Separate the four strands of the master point into two doubled strands.

            <h3>Step Five</h3>
            <p>clip two screwgate carabiners each through 2 seperate strands or collectively through 3. *The carabiners should not share all 4 of the same strands.
