        <h1>Lyrics</h1>
        <p>I'm just a normal boy<br />
        That sank when I fell overboard<br />
        My ship would leave the country<br />
        But I'd rather swim ashore
        </p>
        <p>Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again<br />
        Wish I was much more masculine<br />
        Maybe then I could learn to swim<br />
        Like (14 miles away)
        </p>
        <p>Now floating up and down<br />
        I spin, colliding into sound<br />
        Like whales beneath me diving down<br />
        I'm sinking to the bottom of my<br />
        Everything that freaks me out
        The lighthouse beam has just run out
        I'm cold as cold as cold can be, be
        </p>
        <p>I want to swim away but don't know how<br />
        Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean<br />
        Let the waves up take me down
        Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
        Let the rain of what I feel right now, come down
        Let the rain come down
        </p>
        <p>Where is the coastguard<br />
        I keep looking each direction<br />
        For a spotlight, give me something
        I need something for protection
        Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine
        The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind
        I'm treading for my life, believe me
        (How can I keep up this breathing?)
        </p>
        <p>Not knowing how to think<br />
        I scream aloud,begin to sink<br />
        My legs and arms are broken down<br />
        With envy for the solid ground<br />
        I'm reaching for the life within me
        How can one man stop his ending?
        I thought of just your face
        Relaxed, and floated into space
        </p>
        <p>I want to swim away but don't know how<br />
        Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean<br />
        Let the waves up take me down<br />
        Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah
        Let the rain of what I feel right now come down
        Let the rain come down
        </p>
        <p>Now walking to the sun<br />
        I calculate what I had done<br />
        Like jumping from the bow, yeah<br />
        Just to prove that I knew how, yeah<br />
        It's midnight's late reminder of<br />
        The loss of her, the one I love<br />
        My will to quickly end it all<br />
        Sat front row in my need to fall<br />
        </p>
        <p>Into the ocean, end it all<br />
       Into the ocean, end it all<br />
       Into the ocean, end it all<br />
       Into the ocean, end it all<br />
       Into the ocean, end it all<br />
       Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)<br />
       Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)<br />
       Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye)<br />
        </p>
        <p>I want to swim away but don't know how<br />
        Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean<br />
        Let the waves up take me down<br />
        Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah<br />
        Let the rain of what I feel right now come down<br />
        Let the rain come down
        </p>
        <p>Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye), in to space<br />
        Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye),<br />
        Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye),<br />
        Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye),<br />
        Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye), <br />
        Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye), <br />
        I thought of just your face (end it all)  
        </p>
      <p>Into the ocean end it all <br />
      Into the ocean end it all
      Into the ocean end it all
      Into the ocean end it all
